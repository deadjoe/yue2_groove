YUE2 // GROOVE is the latest music studio built on the open-source Yue2 model and its inference stack. Generate high-quality full songs from style and lyrics with an editable score plan — powered by the latest YuE model — cover from audio with SheetSage2 and MERT2, refine and compare edits, and keep your works in a reusable, easy-to-manage library. You get high-quality creation with real creative control.

Two views, one kernel. **SONG** (the default) is the producer-facing director: one work at a time, its stage
(`DRAFT → SCORE → AUDIO → REVISE → DONE`), a read-only score, playback, and the next actions — no knobs.
**STUDIO** is the full 7-tab gear room. Switch anytime (top right); your work stays intact.

- **SONG** — start cards for NEW SONG / COVER A RECORDING / EDIT A WORK; then stage + next actions
  (`LISTEN` / `EDIT WORK` / `TRY ANOTHER SEED` / `OPEN IN LIBRARY`, …)
- **01 // GENERATE** — style + lyrics (+ optional ABC) → editable plan → full song (plan mode, seed, CFG, sampling)
- **02 // COVER** — recording → SheetSage2 / MERT2 transcription → polish ABC → generate a cover
- **03 // EDIT** — freeze baseline → edit score → check invariants → generate edited → compare
- **04 // LIBRARY** — all works: play, rename, open in EDIT / COVER, durable run history
- **05 // TOOLS** · **06 // DECODE** · **07 // BATCH** — utilities, re-decode, batch jobs
- **Settings rail** — device, dtype, memory budget, ODE steps, models

The UI is a thin layer over the `yue2` package: it never modifies upstream code, and the
single file that imports `yue2` (`yue2_groove/adapter.py`) is covered by contract tests
that fail loudly when an upstream release changes something the UI depends on.

> **Platforms.** Developed and tested on macOS / Apple Silicon (MPS). Linux + NVIDIA CUDA
> is validated end-to-end — generation through the UI, first pass on an NVIDIA L4. See
> [docs/LINUX_CUDA.md](docs/LINUX_CUDA.md) for the measured VRAM budget, ODE-step cost and
> FP8 findings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`pip` also works, see below).
- Apple Silicon Mac with 32 GB or more unified memory (developed on a 64 GB machine), or a
  Linux machine with an NVIDIA GPU of 24 GB (upstream's validated configuration).
- About 8 GB of disk for the model weights (`m-a-p/YuE2-3B` + `m-a-p/YuE2-Vae`), which
  download from Hugging Face on first use.
- The model weights are licensed **CC BY-NC 4.0 (non-commercial)** by the YuE2 project.
- *Optional, for covers:* a separate SheetSage2 environment (Python 3.10/3.11, its own
  torch/transformers, FFmpeg 6.1+) — see [Cover from audio](#cover-from-audio-sheetsage2).
  Everything except 02 COVER works without it.


## Run in Pinokio (easiest)

Prefer not to set up Python by hand? Use the one-click launcher:

**→ [YUE2 // GROOVE on Pinokio](https://pinokio.co/apps/github-com-deadjoe-yue2-groove-pinokio)**  
**→ Launcher repo: [deadjoe/yue2-groove-pinokio](https://github.com/deadjoe/yue2-groove-pinokio)**

<img src="docs/images/pinokio-app-page.png" alt="YUE2 // GROOVE on Pinokio Explore — Install" width="100%">

1. Install **[Pinokio Desktop](https://pinokio.computer)**
2. Open the app page above (or **Explore** → search `YUE2 // GROOVE`) → **Install** → **Start**
3. Alternate: Discover → **Download from URL** → paste `https://github.com/deadjoe/yue2-groove-pinokio`

That path installs YuE2 + Cover (SheetSage2 / MERT2) for you. The manual steps below remain for developers who want a local clone.

## Quick start

1. **Install uv** (skip if you have it):

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone YuE2 and this repository side by side:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE.git
   git clone https://github.com/deadjoe/yue2_groove.git
   cd yue2_groove
   ```

   Already have a YuE2 clone somewhere else? Skip the first line and use its path
   wherever `../YuE` appears below.

3. **Create a virtual environment and install both packages into it.**
   Pick the override file for your platform (it pins two dependency versions; see
   [Why the override file?](#why-the-override-file)):

   ```bash
   uv venv .venv --python 3.12

   # macOS / Apple Silicon
   uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python ../YuE -e . --overrides overrides/macos.txt

   # Linux / NVIDIA CUDA
   uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python ../YuE -e . --overrides overrides/linux.txt
   ```

   Prefer not to clone YuE2 at all? The `yue2` extra pulls the pinned upstream tag
   straight from GitHub: `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e ".[yue2]" --overrides overrides/macos.txt`
   (CI pins the same revision explicitly, and also runs the suite against upstream `main`).

4. **(macOS) Check the attention kernel** — takes a few seconds, loads no weights:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/mps_sdpa_check.py      # expect: "defect not reproduced"
   ```

5. **Start the service:**

   ```bash
   bash scripts/serve.sh start
   ```

   The script prints the local and LAN URLs (default `http://127.0.0.1:7860/`). The model
   loads in the background after the page is up; the first start also downloads the
   weights (about 8 GB) to your Hugging Face cache, so the first generation waits for that.

   Already have the weights on disk (for example in `../YuE/models/YuE2-3B` and
   `../YuE/models/YuE2-Vae`)? Create `.env` **before** the first start so nothing is
   downloaded again:

   ```bash
   echo "YUE2_GROOVE_MODELS=/absolute/path/to/YuE/models" > .env
   ```

6. **Stop, restart, inspect:**

   ```bash
   bash scripts/serve.sh status
   bash scripts/serve.sh log          # follow the log
   bash scripts/serve.sh restart --port 7861
   bash scripts/serve.sh stop
   ```

Generated works land in `runs/` inside this repository (one directory per song with
`audio.flac`, `score.abc`, `request.json`, `config.json`, `result.json`, `latent.npy`,
`semantic.npy` — the same artifacts the official CLI writes, so they stay compatible with
upstream's tools).

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the repository root (ignored by git). Both `scripts/serve.sh`
and the app itself read it, so the settings apply however you launch:

```bash
YUE2_GROOVE_AUTH=alice:my-secret     # login for the web UI; set this before exposing it on a LAN
YUE2_GROOVE_PORT=7860
YUE2_GROOVE_HOST=0.0.0.0             # 127.0.0.1 keeps it local-only
YUE2_GROOVE_RUNS=/path/to/runs       # where works are stored (default: ./runs)
YUE2_GROOVE_MODEL=m-a-p/YuE2-3B      # Hugging Face id or a local directory
YUE2_GROOVE_VAE=m-a-p/YuE2-Vae
YUE2_GROOVE_VAE_LEGACY=m-a-p/YuE2-Vae-legacy
YUE2_GROOVE_MODELS=/path/to/models   # optional: a folder holding YuE2-3B/, YuE2-Vae/, YuE2-Vae-legacy/, SheetSage2/
YUE2_GROOVE_SHEETSAGE_PYTHON=/path/to/.venv-sheetsage2/bin/python   # 02 COVER (separate env)
YUE2_GROOVE_SHEETSAGE_MODEL=m-a-p/SheetSage2   # or a local SheetSage2 snapshot
YUE2_GROOVE_SHEETSAGE_BASE_MODEL=/path/to/MERT-v2-FullSong   # offline parent encoder snapshot
YUE2_GROOVE_SHEETSAGE_DEVICE=auto              # auto | cuda | mps | cpu
YUE2_GROOVE_SHEETSAGE_KEEP_WARM=1             # reuse a resident SheetSage2 worker (faster repeats)
YUE2_GROOVE_SHEETSAGE_IDLE_SECONDS=900        # resident worker idle lifetime
YUE2_GROOVE_TRANSCRIPTIONS=/path/to/transcriptions   # wins over <runs>/transcriptions

# Apple Silicon memory guard: cap PyTorch's MPS allocator so it cannot drive the
# machine into swap.  Defaults are 1.7 (HIGH) / 1.4 (LOW) of the recommended
# working set; 1.7 can exceed physical RAM on a 64 GB Mac (1.7 x 51.8 GiB = 88 GiB)
# and has caused a kernel panic.  Set BOTH: PyTorch rejects a HIGH below the
# default LOW unless LOW is lowered too.  Never use HIGH=0.0 on a shared machine:
# it *disables* the cap (it does not mean zero memory).
PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.8
PYTORCH_MPS_LOW_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.5
```

On Apple Silicon, run `bash scripts/watch_memory.sh` (or `--once` for one
snapshot) in a second terminal while a generation runs: it shows free memory,
kernel pressure, swap, compressor pages and swapfiles, and turns WARN/CRIT well
before the panic state. Keep SWAP and COMPR near zero.

The same things are available as command-line flags:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m yue2_groove --help
.venv/bin/python -m yue2_groove --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7860 --tab 0 \
    --device auto --dtype auto --model m-a-p/YuE2-3B --runs runs --auth alice:secret
bash scripts/serve.sh start --port 7861 --device mps --dtype bfloat16 --no-preload
bash scripts/serve.sh start -f          # foreground, Ctrl-C to stop
```

`--tab` selects the start tab (`0..6`, order: GENERATE, COVER, EDIT, LIBRARY, TOOLS,
DECODE, BATCH) and forces the Studio view.  `--view song|studio` (or
`YUE2_GROOVE_VIEW`) forces a view for the launch without touching the tab; without
either flag the app opens in SONG and remembers your last choice per browser.
`--sheetsage-python` points at the SheetSage2 interpreter (same as
`YUE2_GROOVE_SHEETSAGE_PYTHON`).

`--device auto` picks CUDA → MPS → CPU; `--dtype auto` is bfloat16 on CUDA/MPS (the
checkpoint dtype) and float32 on CPU.

**CUDA without FlashAttention.** Upstream's CUDA-graph decoder (`BACKEND = torch`) calls the
FlashAttention kernel directly and only checks that the operator exists — so a PyTorch build
compiled without FlashAttention (the Windows CUDA wheels, ROCm) or a pre-Ampere GPU (RTX 20xx)
fails at the first decode step with `RuntimeError: USE_FLASH_ATTENTION was not enabled for
build`. The app asks torch first (`torch.backends.cuda.is_flash_attention_available()` and the
GPU's compute capability) and on such hosts runs upstream's own eager decoder instead —
`BACKEND = torch-eager`, the same code path MPS uses: same model and weights, no CUDA graphs,
slower per token. The status line and each run's `local_env.json` say when this happened.
Linux hosts with a FlashAttention-capable build and an Ampere-or-newer GPU are not affected.

**Pre-downloading the weights** (optional, faster than letting the first generation do it):

```bash
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python hf_transfer
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 .venv/bin/hf download m-a-p/YuE2-3B
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 .venv/bin/hf download m-a-p/YuE2-Vae
```

If you keep weights in local directories instead (for example `../YuE/models/YuE2-3B`),
set `YUE2_GROOVE_MODELS=../YuE/models` or pass `--model /path/to/YuE2-3B`.

## Why the override file?

Two dependency pins conflict, and `uv`'s `--overrides` resolves both without touching
upstream code:

| Pin | Reason |
|---|---|
| `torch==2.14.0` (macOS only) | YuE2 pins `torch==2.10.0`, whose MPS single-query attention kernel reads out of bounds once the KV cache passes 1024 tokens ([pytorch/pytorch#174861](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/174861)) — in bfloat16 the values turn to garbage and NaN well before a minute of audio. Fixed in torch 2.11. `scripts/mps_sdpa_check.py` reproduces the defect on 2.10 and passes on 2.11+. |
| `huggingface-hub==0.36.2` | Gradio asks for `huggingface-hub>=1.16`, YuE2 pins `0.36.2` (transformers 4.57.x needs it). Keeping upstream's pin is safe; Gradio works with it. |

With plain `pip` there is no override mechanism; install in this order and accept the
version warning:

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install ../YuE
pip install -e .
pip install "huggingface-hub==0.36.2"            # both platforms
pip install "torch==2.14.0"                      # macOS only
```

[docs/LINUX_CUDA.md](docs/LINUX_CUDA.md).
Why the same seed produces a different song on macOS than on CUDA — five controlled runs,
two experiments, the sampler-level cause, and a blind listening test on a fixed composition
that finds no platform deficit: [docs/CROSS_PLATFORM.md](docs/CROSS_PLATFORM.md).

## Cover from audio (SheetSage2)

**02 // COVER** turns a recording into a cover: upload audio → SheetSage2 transcribes it to ABC
(melody-only or full score) → review/edit the score, strip chords → **SEND TO GENERATE** fills
the ABC and the right plan mode, or **GENERATE COVER** generates right on the COVER tab with its
own style/lyrics → the normal YuE2 generation path runs unchanged. A previously saved score or
transcription can be reused after a page reload with **SOURCE WORK → LOAD ABC** (optionally then
**SEND TO EDIT**).

SheetSage2 pins different torch/transformers versions than YuE2, so it runs in its **own
virtual environment** and the UI talks to it over a subprocess boundary: nothing in the groove
process imports `transformers`, and an unconfigured SheetSage2 cannot break the rest of the UI.
Install it next to the YuE checkout (Linux/CUDA shown; see the model card for others):

```bash
cd /path/to/YuE
python3.11 -m venv .venv-sheetsage2
.venv-sheetsage2/bin/python -m pip install huggingface-hub==0.36.0
.venv-sheetsage2/bin/hf download m-a-p/SheetSage2 --local-dir models/SheetSage2
.venv-sheetsage2/bin/python -m pip install torch==2.8.0 torchaudio==2.8.0 \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
.venv-sheetsage2/bin/python -m pip install -r models/SheetSage2/requirements.txt

# in yue2_groove/.env (or pass --sheetsage-python on the command line)
YUE2_GROOVE_SHEETSAGE_PYTHON=/path/to/YuE/.venv-sheetsage2/bin/python
```

FFmpeg 6.1+ must be on `PATH`. MERT-v2-FullSong, SheetSage2's parent encoder, downloads
automatically — do not install it separately. On macOS use the same commands without the CUDA
index and `device=mps` (untested) or `device=cpu` (works, slow). The **CHECK ENVIRONMENT**
button probes the second venv without loading weights and **AUTO-DETECT VENV** finds
`./.venv-sheetsage2` or `../YuE/.venv-sheetsage2` for the session; the TRANSCRIBE task picks
vocal-only, vocal+instrumental, or full-score (with chords) output, and **MELODY VOICES**
decides which melodies a cover keeps. **KEEP SHEETSAGE2 WARM** reuses one
resident worker between transcriptions (fast repeats; **UNLOAD SHEETSAGE2** or the idle reaper
frees it), while the default is a fresh process per transcription that returns all memory on
exit. Running both models sequentially on one GPU is the supported setup.

Manual walkthrough (`C1`/`C2`), failure behavior and hardware expectations:
[docs/COVER_EDIT.md](docs/COVER_EDIT.md).

## Edit a work and compare

**03 // EDIT** is the iteration loop from the upstream skill: load a saved work → **FREEZE
BASELINE** (hashes + copies of `score.abc`/`request.json`; the original run directory is never
modified) → edit the ABC → **CHECK INVARIANTS** (exact sounding-note/meter comparison, per
voice, with an explicit allow-tempo flag) → **GENERATE EDITED**.

CHECK INVARIANTS runs under an explicit contract: **EXACT** keeps sounding notes and the
meter grid (tempo/meter changes can be permitted), **PITCH** keeps only the ordered pitch
sequence so rhythm may change, **FREE** records differences without gating. The contract and
permissions are written to `edit_manifest.json`.

Generation refuses to run unless the check passed on exactly the current ABC: the edited score
is always submitted, so an edit can never silently fall back to a fresh plan. `ALLOW
MELODY/RHYTHM CHANGES` exists for intentional adaptations: it only lets a *failing* check
through — FREEZE BASELINE and CHECK INVARIANTS are always required. Sampling parameters are
shared with 01 GENERATE (the EDIT tab mirrors them read-only). Each attempt is a new run directory
with `edit_manifest.json` (source/edit hashes, frozen flag, invariant result, permitted changes),
and **BUILD COMPARISON // baseline vs edit** creates a local listening page from both runs.

Manual walkthrough (`E1`) and the failure cases (`X`):
[docs/COVER_EDIT.md](docs/COVER_EDIT.md).

## Compare the three plan modes

**ALL MODES** (01 GENERATE) runs the same text request three times — `full`, `melody`, `off` —
like upstream's `all-modes`: text-only input (an ABC would be invalid for `off`), one fresh
directory per mode under `runs/<stamp>-allmodes-<id>/`, a `run.json` summary at the group root,
and a retained `failure.json` when one mode fails while the others keep running. Each mode
appears in 04 LIBRARY like any other work, and when at least two modes complete the UI also
builds the same local listening bundle as 05 TOOLS with the link shown under the buttons.

## Tips: creativity knobs and instrumental / vocals

- **[Generation creativity knobs](docs/GENERATION_CREATIVITY_KNOBS.md)** — producer guide: three ideas (CFG / temperature+seed / plan mode), recipes, then a short glossary.
- **[Exclude / instrumental research](docs/EXCLUDE_INSTRUMENTAL_RESEARCH.md)** — YuE2 has no Suno-style exclude API; upstream issues, community workarounds (empty lyric sections, ABC `V: Vocal` rests), and what groove can/cannot do.

## Keeping up with upstream

YuE2 moves quickly. This UI pins nothing about upstream at the code level; the compatibility
matrix is:

| yue2-groove | YuE2 (`yue2-infer`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0.8.x | `yue2-v0.1.6` | NAR/VAE progress via an internal hook; a [pull request](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE/pull/173) adds a public `on_progress` callback that the UI uses automatically once merged |

SheetSage2 is used only by 02 COVER, through its Transformers interface
(`AutoModel.from_pretrained(..., trust_remote_code=True)` then `transcribe(..., melody_only=True)`).
The driver verifies that `melody_only` is an explicit keyword and refuses older revisions
instead of guessing; it never imports SheetSage2's code into this process.

To upgrade YuE2:

```bash
git -C ../YuE pull
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python ../YuE --overrides overrides/macos.txt   # or linux.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q          # contract tests: green means the UI still matches upstream
```

If `tests/test_contract.py` fails, upstream changed something the UI relies on; the fix
belongs in `yue2_groove/adapter.py`, the only module that imports `yue2`.

## Development

```bash
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e ".[test]" --overrides overrides/macos.txt
.venv/bin/ruff check .                                    # the one lint gate (config in pyproject.toml)
.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q yue2_groove tests scripts
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

The lint rule set lives in `[tool.ruff]` (pyproject.toml) so CI and local runs use the
same gate; `yue2_groove/vendor/` is excluded because it is an upstream byte-identical
copy (see NOTICE).

- `yue2_groove/webui.py` — the Gradio app (all tabs, theme, client-side helpers).
- `yue2_groove/library.py` — the Library backend; standard library only, reads run
  directories by file convention and never imports `yue2`.
- `yue2_groove/adapter.py` — every call into `yue2`; keep it that way.
- `yue2_groove/sheetsage_adapter.py` — the only module that runs SheetSage2; subprocess,
  progress, cancel. It never imports `transformers` in this process.
- `yue2_groove/sheetsage_driver.py` — the stdlib-only script executed inside the SheetSage2
  venv (adapted from upstream's `skills/yue2-music/scripts/transcribe.py`).
- `yue2_groove/cover.py` — transcription task → plan mode, chord stripping, cover request.
- `yue2_groove/edit_flow.py` — baseline freeze, invariant check, edit manifest.
- `yue2_groove/vendor/` — `abc_tools.py` and `listen.py` copied from upstream's
  `skills/yue2-music/scripts` (Apache 2.0; the wheel does not ship them).
- `scripts/serve.sh` — service manager; `scripts/mps_sdpa_check.py` — MPS kernel guard.
- `docs/COVER_EDIT.md` — 02 COVER / 03 EDIT manual, manual E2E checks C1/C2/E1/X.
- `docs/GENERATION_CREATIVITY_KNOBS.md` — producer-facing GENERATE creativity guide (recipes + glossary).
- `docs/EXCLUDE_INSTRUMENTAL_RESEARCH.md` — upstream research: no exclude API; instrumental workarounds.
- `docs/LINUX_CUDA.md` — Linux + NVIDIA CUDA validation: measured VRAM budget and boundaries, ODE steps, FP8 cost.
- `docs/CROSS_PLATFORM.md` — CUDA vs Apple MPS: why the same seed differs (sampler RNG device), what was ruled out, measured performance ratios.
